<h2 id="special-requirements-for-general-purpose-ai-models">Special Requirements for General Purpose AI Models</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>GPAI and Foundation Models</h3>
  <p>The EU AI Act includes specific provisions for general purpose AI (GPAI) models, including foundation models, that can be used across a wide range of applications. These requirements vary based on the model's capabilities and potential systemic risk.</p>
  
  <h4>Providers of All GPAI Models Must:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Draw up technical documentation</li>
    <li>Establish a policy to comply with EU copyright law</li>
    <li>Provide information on the content used for training</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Additional Requirements for High-Impact GPAI Models:</h4>
  <p>GPAI models are considered "high-impact" if they require substantial computing resources for training (≥ 10^25 FLOPs) or meet other criteria established by the AI Office. For these models, providers must:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Conduct model evaluation and testing for serious risks</li>
    <li>Assess and mitigate systemic risks</li>
    <li>Report serious incidents</li>
    <li>Ensure adequate cybersecurity protection</li>
    <li>Report energy consumption and efficiency metrics</li>
    <li>Provide detailed information about the model's development</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="note-box">
    <h4>Important Note on Model Adaptation:</h4>
    <p>If you adapt a GPAI model for a specific purpose that falls under the high-risk category, you become subject to all high-risk system requirements, even if you didn't develop the original model.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="compliance-documentation-requirements">Compliance Documentation Requirements</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Documentation Essentials</h3>
  <p>Documentation is a cornerstone of EU AI Act compliance, particularly for high-risk systems. Well-structured documentation not only demonstrates compliance but also promotes responsible AI development practices.</p>
  
  <h4>Key Documentation Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems:</h4>
  
  <div class="documentation-section">
    <h5>1. Technical Documentation</h5>
    <p>Must be prepared before the AI system is placed on the market and kept up-to-date. Essential elements include:</p>
    <ul>

<h2 id="conformity-assessment-procedures">Conformity Assessment Procedures</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Demonstrating Compliance</h3>
  <p>High-risk AI systems must undergo conformity assessment before being placed on the EU market. The type of conformity assessment required depends on the nature of the AI system.</p>
  
  <h4>Two Routes to Conformity Assessment:</h4>
  
  <div class="conformity-option">
    <h5>1. Internal Conformity Assessment</h5>
    <p>For high-risk AI systems other than those related to products covered by specific legislation (e.g., medical devices, machinery), providers can conduct internal conformity assessment based on Annex VI of the AI Act.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Verify system compliance with all requirements through internal testing and evaluation</li>
      <li>Prepare comprehensive technical documentation</li>
      <li>Implement quality and risk management systems</li>
      <li>Draw up EU Declaration of Conformity</li>
      <li>Register the system in the EU database before placing it on the market</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div class="conformity-option">
    <h5>2. Third-Party Conformity Assessment</h5>
    <p>Required for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-risk AI systems that are part of products already requiring third-party assessment under existing product legislation</li>
      <li>Certain remote biometric identification systems</li>
      <li>Other systems as may be specified in implementing acts</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify an appropriate notified body authorized to perform the assessment</li>
      <li>Submit technical documentation and evidence of compliance</li>
      <li>Undergo examination and testing by the notified body</li>
      <li>Address any identified non-compliance issues</li>
      <li>Receive conformity certificate</li>
      <li>Draw up EU Declaration of Conformity</li>
      <li>Register the system in the EU database before placing it on the market</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <h4>CE Marking</h4>
  <p>After successful completion of the conformity assessment procedure, high-risk AI systems must bear the CE marking to indicate compliance with the EU AI Act and other applicable legislation.</p>
  
  <div class="note-box">
    <h4>Important Note:</h4>
    <p>The conformity assessment process is not a one-time activity. Significant modifications to high-risk AI systems trigger the need for a new conformity assessment before the modified system can be placed on the market or put into service.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="compliance-organizational-structure">Compliance Organizational Structure</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Establishing Your Compliance Team</h3>
  <p>Implementing EU AI Act compliance effectively requires a structured approach and clear allocation of responsibilities. Here's a suggested organizational framework:</p>
  
  <div class="organizational-chart">
    <div class="org-level">
      <h4>Executive Level</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Executive Sponsor</strong> - Senior executive responsible for AI governance and compliance</li>
        <li><strong>Chief AI Ethics Officer</strong> - Leadership role focused on responsible AI across the organization</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="org-level">
      <h4>Management Level</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Compliance Manager</strong> - Oversees day-to-day compliance activities and coordinates cross-functional efforts</li>
        <li><strong>Product/Business Line Managers</strong> - Responsible for compliance within their specific product areas</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Management Lead</strong> - Oversees risk assessment and mitigation strategies</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="org-level">
      <h4>Operational Level</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical AI Teams</strong> - Engineers and data scientists who implement compliance measures in AI systems</li>
        <li><strong>Legal &amp; Regulatory Affairs</strong> - Provide legal expertise on regulatory requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation Specialists</strong> - Manage technical documentation and conformity assessment processes</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong> - Test and verify compliance of AI systems</li>
        <li><strong>Training &amp; Awareness</strong> - Develop and deliver training programs on compliance requirements</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <h4>Key Functions and Responsibilities:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Risk Assessment</strong> - Identifying and classifying AI systems, conducting risk analyses</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation Management</strong> - Preparing and maintaining required technical and compliance documentation</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance Monitoring</strong> - Ongoing assessment of compliance status and changes in regulatory requirements</li>

    <li><strong>Training &amp; Awareness</strong> - Ensuring all relevant personnel understand compliance requirements</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <h4>Implementation Tip:</h4>
    <p>For smaller organizations, individuals may need to wear multiple hats across these functions. The key is to ensure all essential compliance activities are covered, even if the organizational structure is simplified.</p>
