  <h3>About This Guide</h3>
  <p>This reference guide provides clear, structured information about the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) - the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence. We've designed this resource to help developers, businesses, policymakers, and interested individuals understand the core concepts, requirements, and implications of this landmark regulation.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="understanding-the-eu-ai-act">Understanding the EU AI Act</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>What is the EU AI Act?</h3>
  <p>The EU AI Act is a comprehensive legal framework that establishes rules for the development, placement on the market, and use of artificial intelligence systems within the European Union. Adopted in 2024, it creates obligations for providers and users of AI systems according to a risk-based approach.</p>
  
  <p>Key objectives of the regulation include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensuring AI systems placed on the EU market are safe and respect fundamental rights</li>
    <li>Creating legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI</li>
    <li>Enhancing governance and enforcement of existing law applicable to AI</li>
    <li>Facilitating the development of a single market for lawful, safe, and trustworthy AI</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="the-risk-based-approach">The Risk-Based Approach</h2>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Four Risk Categories</h3>
  <p>The EU AI Act classifies AI systems according to the level of risk they pose, with different requirements for each category:</p>
  
  <div class="risk-category-section">
    <p><span class="risk-category risk-prohibited-tag">Prohibited</span><br />
    AI applications deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to people's safety, livelihoods, and rights are banned.</p>
    
    <p><span class="risk-category risk-high-tag">High-Risk</span><br />
    AI systems that could harm people's health, safety, fundamental rights, or the environment are subject to strict requirements before they can be put on the market.</p>
    
    <p><span class="risk-category risk-limited-tag">Limited Risk</span><br />
    Systems with specific transparency obligations, such as chatbots or deepfakes, where users should be informed they are interacting with AI.</p>
    
    <p><span class="risk-category risk-minimal-tag">Minimal Risk</span><br />
    The vast majority of AI systems fall into this category and are subject to limited or no obligations.</p>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Essential Insights</h3>
  <p>These core principles are critical to understanding the EU AI Act's approach and implementation:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Risk-Based Regulation</strong> - The Act doesn't regulate AI technology itself but regulates based on risk levels of specific applications. Higher risks mean stricter rules.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Extraterritorial Impact</strong> - Like GDPR, the EU AI Act affects organizations worldwide that offer AI systems or their outputs in the EU market, not just EU-based entities.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Progressive Implementation</strong> - Different provisions take effect over time (2024-2027), creating a phased compliance roadmap rather than a single enforcement date.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Technology Neutrality</strong> - The Act focuses on AI functionality and use cases rather than specific technologies, making it adaptable to evolving AI techniques.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Harmonized Standards</strong> - The regulatory framework establishes a system of harmonized standards and common rules across all EU member states.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Balance of Innovation and Protection</strong> - The Act aims to protect fundamental rights while enabling innovation through measures like regulatory sandboxes.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Focus on High-Risk Systems</strong> - The most detailed regulatory requirements focus on high-risk AI applications, with lighter obligations for other risk categories.</li>
  </ol>
