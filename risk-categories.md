# EU AI Act Risk Categories

<div class="card">
  <h3>Risk-Based Regulation</h3>
  <p>The EU AI Act adopts a risk-based approach to regulating artificial intelligence, with different requirements depending on the risk level of your AI system. This page explains the four main risk categories and helps you determine where your AI system fits.</p>
</div>

## Risk Classification Overview

<div class="card">
  <h3>Four-Tier Risk Structure</h3>
  <p>The EU AI Act categorizes AI systems into four main risk levels, with regulatory requirements proportionate to the level of risk:</p>
  
  <div class="risk-pyramid">
    <div class="risk-level risk-prohibited">
      <h4>🚫 Unacceptable Risk</h4>
      <p>Prohibited AI systems</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk-level risk-high">
      <h4>⚠️ High Risk</h4>
      <p>Subject to strict requirements</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk-level risk-limited">
      <h4>⚡ Limited Risk</h4>
      <p>Subject to transparency obligations</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk-level risk-minimal">
